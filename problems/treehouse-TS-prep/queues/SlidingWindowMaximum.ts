// 239. Sliding Window Maximum
// https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/description/


// You are given an array of integers nums, 
// there is a sliding window of size k 
// which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. 
// You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

// Return the max sliding window.

function maxSlidingWindow(nums: number[], k: number): number[] {
    const solution = []
    
    return []
};

// PLAN
// const solution = []

// const initialArr = nums from 0 to k
// let currentMax = Math.max(initialArr). --- could probably do this in one operation

// let left = k
// let right = k + k



// return solution
