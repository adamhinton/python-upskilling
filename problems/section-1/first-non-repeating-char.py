# Instructions are too long to copy here, but basically:
# Take string input
# Return first character that only appears in the string once
# Upper and lowercase chars are considered the same character, but fn...
    # ... should return the correct case for initial letter
# Edge cases:
    # If all characters repeat, return ""

def first_non_repeating_letter(input: str) -> str:
    # Dummy placeholder
    return ""
