# Merge Sort

## Overview
- Divide and conquer algorithm
    - Break down in to multiple subproblems recursively until they become simple to solve
    - Solutions are then combined to solve the original problem

## Time complexity
    - O(n log n) runtime
    - This is the optimal runtime for comparison based algorithms

## General merge sort principles:
    1.  Split array in half
    2. Call merge sort on each half to sort them recursively
    3. Merge both sorted halves in to one sorted array
