# 735. Asteroid Collision
# https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/description/

# We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row. 
# The indices of the asteroid in the array represent their relative position in space.

# For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, 
# and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left).
#  Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

# Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. 
# If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. 
# If both are the same size, both will explode. 
# Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.
