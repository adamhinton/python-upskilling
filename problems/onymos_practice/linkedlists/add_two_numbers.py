# 2. Add Two Numbers
# https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/

# Medium

# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

# Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
# Output: [7,0,8]
# Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 9
# It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
