# https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/description/

# Given an integer array nums of unique elements, 
# return all possible subsets (the power set).

# The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. 
# Return the solution in any order.

# NEED:
    # Backtracking
    # Recursion

# Time complexity:
    # a lot
    # 2 ^ n I think
